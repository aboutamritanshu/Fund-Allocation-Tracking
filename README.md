# Blockchain Fund Allocation, Tracking, and Transferring

## Project Overview

This project is a decentralized application (DApp) designed to manage, track, and transfer funds using blockchain technology. It provides a transparent, secure, and efficient method to handle financial transactions, ensuring accountability and minimizing the risk of fraud.

## Key Features

1. **Decentralized Fund Management:** Efficiently allocate and manage funds using a transparent blockchain ledger.
2. **Real-Time Tracking:** Monitor fund movements with an immutable, real-time transaction history.
3. **Secure Transfers:** Ensure secure, trustless fund transfers between accounts using blockchain technology.
4. **User-Friendly Interface:** Leverage HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for an intuitive and responsive user experience.
5. **Smart Contracts:** Implement core functionalities with Solidity for automated, secure, and reliable operations.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** Structuring the web pages.
- **CSS:** Styling the web pages.
- **JavaScript:** Adding interactivity and dynamic functionalities.
- **Solidity:** Writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/blockchain-fund-allocation.git
    cd blockchain-fund-allocation
    ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:
